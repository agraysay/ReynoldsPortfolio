			<blockquote id="block"> Hi! I'm Amanda. <br>I grew up in the Detroit area and recently graduated from college in New York, where I studied New Media. I love to travel and I was lucky enough to get to spend 8 months in Denmark and travel to many European countries. I currently work as a screenprinter and graphic designer at Underground Printing, a print shop in Ann Arbor. I love technology, politics, design, travel, cats and mexican food. My dream job is to work for a media company, creating interactive web experiences to help people better understand environmental and social issues that effect everyday life. I can't wait to start my journey at Grand Circus! </blockquote>
